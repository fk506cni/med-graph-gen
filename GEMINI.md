## Project Status: Full Pipeline Implemented and Enhanced

**Objective:** Develop a system to generate a knowledge graph CSV from a PDF document.

### Key Developments

*   **End-to-End Pipeline:** A complete, 5-step pipeline has been implemented to process a PDF, extract knowledge, and generate a graph CSV.
*   **LLM-Powered Normalization (Step 4):**
    *   Implemented `step4_normalize.py` to unify entity notations (e.g., abbreviations, synonyms).
    *   The script queries an LLM in batches to get normalization suggestions.
    *   A majority-voting system was introduced to consolidate suggestions from all batches, creating a single, robust normalization map. This enhances consistency.
*   **CSV Export (Step 5):**
    *   Implemented `step5_export.py` to convert the normalized data into final `nodes.csv` and `edges.csv` files.
    *   Nodes are assigned unique IDs (e.g., `DISEASE_001`), and edges are mapped to these IDs, making the output ready for graph database ingestion.
*   **Intermediate File Naming Convention:**
    *   All intermediate files (`structured_text.json`, `cleaned_text.json`, `entities.json`, `relations.jsonl`, `normalized_entities.json`, `normalized_relations.jsonl`, `normalization_map.json`, `nodes.csv`, `edges.csv`) have been renamed to include their respective step numbers (e.g., `step1_structured_text.json`, `step5_nodes.csv`) for better clarity and traceability.
*   **LLM Model Selection:**
    *   Added a `--model` command-line argument to `main.py` allowing users to specify the LLM model to be used (defaulting to `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`). This provides flexibility and control over model choice.
*   **Processing Limits Removed:**
    *   Removed the page range limit in `step1_extract.py` (now processes all pages by default).
    *   Removed the maximum batch limit in `step3b_llm_based_relations.py` (now processes all entity pairs by default).
*   **Refined Execution Commands:**
    *   The `README.md` has been updated with precise `docker run` commands, including all necessary volume mounts for prompt files, ensuring reproducibility.

### Debugging and Stabilization

*   Resolved a `KeyError` in `step4` by escaping curly braces in the prompt template.
*   Fixed a `NameError` in `step5` by correcting the import scope of the `defaultdict` collection.
*   Addressed `list index out of range` error in `step2a` by implementing safer indexing when combining LLM responses with source information.

### Current State

*   The full pipeline from PDF to CSV is complete and functional.
*   The system can successfully extract, cleanse, relate, normalize, and export knowledge from the sample PDF.
*   The project is well-documented in the `README.md`, including setup and execution instructions.

### Recent Updates (August 1, 2025)

*   **Completed Step 4 (Normalization):** Implemented and refined the LLM-based normalization logic with a majority-voting mechanism.
*   **Completed Step 5 (Export):** Implemented the final CSV export functionality.
*   **Intermediate File Naming:** Renamed intermediate files for clarity.
*   **LLM Model Control:** Added `--model` argument for LLM selection.
*   **Processing Limits:** Removed artificial processing limits in `step1` and `step3b`.
*   **Documentation:** Updated `README.md` and `GEMINI.md` to reflect the completed project status and provide accurate execution commands.

### Next Steps

*   The core implementation is complete. Future work could involve:
    *   Testing with a wider range of PDF documents.
    *   Optimizing LLM prompts and processing parameters for cost and accuracy.
    *   Adding more sophisticated error handling and logging.

*   **Debugging:** `list index out of range` error in `step2a` is resolved.
