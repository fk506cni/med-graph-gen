## Project Status: Full Pipeline Implemented

**Objective:** Develop a system to generate a knowledge graph CSV from a PDF document.

### Key Developments

*   **End-to-End Pipeline:** A complete, 5-step pipeline has been implemented to process a PDF, extract knowledge, and generate a graph CSV.
*   **LLM-Powered Normalization (Step 4):**
    *   Implemented `step4_normalize.py` to unify entity notations (e.g., abbreviations, synonyms).
    *   The script queries an LLM in batches to get normalization suggestions.
    *   A majority-voting system was introduced to consolidate suggestions from all batches, creating a single, robust normalization map. This enhances consistency.
*   **CSV Export (Step 5):**
    *   Implemented `step5_export.py` to convert the normalized data into final `nodes.csv` and `edges.csv` files.
    *   Nodes are assigned unique IDs (e.g., `DISEASE_001`), and edges are mapped to these IDs, making the output ready for graph database ingestion.
*   **Refined Execution Commands:**
    *   The `README.md` has been updated with precise `docker run` commands, including all necessary volume mounts for prompt files, ensuring reproducibility.
*   **Debugging and Stabilization:**
    *   Resolved a `KeyError` in `step4` by escaping curly braces in the prompt template.
    *   Fixed a `NameError` in `step5` by correcting the import scope of the `defaultdict` collection.

### Current State

*   The full pipeline from PDF to CSV is complete and functional.
*   The system can successfully extract, cleanse, relate, normalize, and export knowledge from the sample PDF.
*   The project is well-documented in the `README.md`, including setup and execution instructions.

### Recent Updates (August 1, 2025)

*   **Completed Step 4 (Normalization):** Implemented and refined the LLM-based normalization logic with a majority-voting mechanism.
*   **Completed Step 5 (Export):** Implemented the final CSV export functionality.
*   **Documentation:** Updated `README.md` and `GEMINI.md` to reflect the completed project status and provide accurate execution commands.

### Next Steps

*   The core implementation is complete. Future work could involve:
    *   Testing with a wider range of PDF documents.
    *   Optimizing LLM prompts and processing parameters for cost and accuracy.
    *   Adding more sophisticated error handling and logging.
