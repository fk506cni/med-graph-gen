## Project Status: Full Pipeline Implemented and Enhanced

**Objective:** Develop a system to generate a knowledge graph CSV from a PDF document.

### Key Developments

*   **End-to-End Pipeline:** A complete, 5-step pipeline has been implemented to process a PDF, extract knowledge, and generate a graph CSV.
*   **LLM-Powered Normalization (Step 4):**
    *   Implemented `step4_normalize.py` to unify entity notations (e.g., abbreviations, synonyms).
    *   The script queries an LLM in batches to get normalization suggestions.
    *   A majority-voting system was introduced to consolidate suggestions from all batches, creating a single, robust normalization map. This enhances consistency.
*   **CSV Export (Step 5):**
    *   Implemented `step5_export.py` to convert the normalized data into final `nodes.csv` and `edges.csv` files.
    *   Nodes are assigned unique IDs (e.g., `DISEASE_001`), and edges are mapped to these IDs, making the output ready for graph database ingestion.
    *   **Added Normalization Graph Export:** The normalization map itself is now exported as a separate graph (`step5_normalization_nodes.csv`, `step5_normalization_edges.csv`), making the normalization process transparent and analyzable.
*   **Intermediate File Naming Convention:**
    *   All intermediate files have been renamed to include their respective step numbers (e.g., `step1_structured_text.json`, `step5_nodes.csv`) for better clarity and traceability.
*   **Command-Line Arguments for Flexibility:**
    *   Added a `--model` argument to `main.py` for LLM model selection.
    *   Added `--start_page` and `--end_page` arguments to control the page range for PDF processing in `step1`.
    *   Added a `--wait` argument to specify the delay between LLM API calls to prevent rate limiting issues.
*   **Processing Limits Removed:**
    *   Removed the page range limit in `step1_extract.py` (now processes all pages by default, controllable by args).
    *   Removed the maximum batch limit in `step3b_llm_based_relations.py` (now processes all entity pairs by default).
*   **Refined Execution Commands:**
    *   The `README.md` has been updated with precise `docker run` commands, including all necessary volume mounts and examples for new arguments, ensuring reproducibility.

### Debugging and Stabilization

*   Resolved a `KeyError` in `step6` during CSV import. The issue was caused by a Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of the CSV files, which was prepended to the first column's header. The fix involved changing the file encoding to `utf-8-sig` in `step6_import_to_neo4j.py` and adding logic to strip the BOM character from the header keys, ensuring correct column name recognition.
*   Resolved a `KeyError` in `step4` by escaping curly braces in the prompt template.
*   Fixed a `NameError` in `step5` by correcting the import scope of the `defaultdict` collection.
*   Addressed `list index out of range` error in `step2a` by implementing safer indexing.
*   Fixed a `NameError` in `step3b` by correcting a typo in a variable name.

### Current State

*   The full pipeline from PDF to Neo4j is complete and functional.
*   The system can successfully extract, cleanse, relate, normalize, export, and import knowledge from the sample PDF into a graph database.
*   The project is well-documented in the `README.md`, including setup and execution instructions.

### Recent Updates (August 2, 2025)

*   **Implemented Neo4j Import (Step 6):** Added a new pipeline step (`step6_import_to_neo4j.py`) to automatically import the generated knowledge graph CSVs into a Neo4j Aura database. This includes adding the `neo4j` dependency and updating the main pipeline script.
*   **Added CLI Arguments:** Implemented `--wait`, `--start_page`, and `--end_page` arguments for better control over the pipeline execution.
*   **Enhanced Step 5:** Added functionality to export the normalization map as a separate graph.
*   **Documentation:** Updated `README.md` and `GEMINI.md` to reflect the latest changes, including new features and updated, more robust execution commands.

### Next Steps

*   The core implementation is complete. Future work could involve:
    *   Testing with a wider range of PDF documents.
    *   Optimizing LLM prompts and processing parameters for cost and accuracy.
    *   Adding more sophisticated error handling and logging.
